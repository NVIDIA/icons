# Contributing to NVIDIA Icons

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NVIDIA Icons.

Worth knowing upfront: this repository is a one-way sync from NVIDIA's
internal design system, not a place where the icon set itself is designed in
the open. Code, docs, and bug-fix contributions are welcome and reviewed like
any open-source project; icon *design*, meaning what gets added, changed, or removed,
is decided internally, with community requests taken as input (see below).

Also worth knowing: parts of this project's code, docs, and governance files
were drafted with AI coding-assistant help and reviewed by a human maintainer
before merging, the same as any other contribution. Ongoing work of that kind
carries a `Co-Authored-By` trailer; this repository opens with a single
squashed commit, so trailers only appear from that point on.

## What contributions are accepted

- **Bug reports** — incorrect TypeScript types, broken package exports, build
  failures, install errors, accessibility issues in React components.
- **Documentation improvements** — typos, clarity improvements, missing usage
  examples.
- **Code fixes** — corrections to generated component logic (not generated
  content itself, which comes from the internal sync).

**Icon design contributions are not accepted as direct pull requests.**
If you need a new icon or find an existing icon is wrong, open an issue using the
Icon Request template on our
[new-issue page](https://github.com/NVIDIA/icons/issues/new/choose). NVIDIA
design and brand owners review all icon requests internally.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This project uses the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/).
All commits must include a `Signed-off-by` trailer:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

Add it automatically with:

```sh
git commit --signoff
```

The `dco-check` job in this repo's GitHub Actions CI (visible on your PR, in
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml)) will fail on
any commit that is missing the trailer.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22.12 or newer.** That floor is the build toolchain's, not the
  packages' — Vite requires it. What we publish still runs on any Node 22, so
  the `engines.node` in each `packages/*/package.json` stays `>=22`; only the
  root one is `>=22.12`. CI runs the full build and test suite on Node 22 and
  24 (see the `node-matrix` job). `.nvmrc` pins 24 for local development and
  for the single-version CI jobs; `nvm use` picks it up.
- **npm 10 or newer** (bundled with Node 22+). No other package manager is
  supported; this repo uses npm workspaces and ships a `package-lock.json`.
  Release tasks (`npm sbom`, `npm publish --provenance`) need npm >= 11.5;
  see `packageManager` in the root `package.json` for the exact version CI
  uses for those.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch from `main`: `git checkout -b fix/my-fix`.
3. Make your changes. Add or update tests if applicable.
4. Ensure CI passes locally:
   ```sh
   npm ci
   npm run build
   npm run lint
   npm run typecheck
   npm run test
   npm run test:react-compat
   npm run verify:packaging
   ```
5. Commit with `--signoff`, using a [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
   message: `git commit --signoff -m "fix: describe the fix"`. `npm ci` installs
   a `commit-msg` git hook (via [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)) that
   checks this locally; the `commitlint-check` CI job checks it again on the PR
   so the rule holds even if the hook was skipped or never installed.
6. Push your branch and open a pull request against `main`.

## Sync-generated content

The `packages/*/src/generated/`, `packages/*/src/icons/`, and
`packages/*/assets/` directories are populated by automated sync from
NVIDIA's internal monorepo. Do not edit these files manually; changes will
be overwritten on the next sync.

## Code style

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting.
Run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-format before committing.
